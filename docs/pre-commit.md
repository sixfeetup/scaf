## What is pre-commit
We use pre-commit hooks to run security and linting checks before each commit. For more information, see https://pre-commit.com/.

## Installation using pip:

`$ pip install pre-commit`

## Install the git hook scripts

`$ pre-commit install`

*now pre-commit will run automatically on git commit*

## Update pre-commit

`pre-commit autoupdate`
