# The Sixie Opinionated Django Cookiecutter

This is a work in progress, but it is heavily inspired by the work
of [cookiecutter-django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django)
and Daniel Roy Greenfeld. It also borrows heavily from the ideas in the
PyPA [warehouse](https://github.com/pypa/warehouse) as I feel they have
made an amazing developer onboarding experience for a very complicated
project.

## Installing cookiecutter

To use this template, you need to install
[cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) first. You can follow the
[instructions](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) for your operating system.

The quickest way is performing a [user install](https://pip-python3.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide.html#user-installs)
using the following command:

  $ python3 -m pip install --user cookiecutter

To verify if your install worked, you can use the following command (the versions may be
different for you):

  $ cookiecutter --version
  Cookiecutter 2.1.1 from /home/user/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages (Python 3.10.6 (main, Nov 14 2022, 16:10:14) [GCC 11.3.0])

You will also need [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) and [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/). You can install them using the commands:

  $ python3 -m pip install --user black
  $ python3 -m pip install --user isort

## Creating a new project using this repo

With [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) installed
in your environment you can create a new project with the command:

  $ cookiecutter https://github.com/sixfeetup/cookiecutter-sixiedjango/ -o [project_destination_directory]

Answer all the questions, and you'll have your new project!

Inside `[project_destination_directory]/[project_slug]/README.md` you will have more
documentation explaining how to use and configure your newly created project.

## Development on the Cookie Cutter

When making changes to the Cookie Cutter, keep the following in mind:

- update pins in requirements/*.in files but *don't\* commit the compiled requirements.txt
  files to the repo.
- update to latest Python supported by Django. For Django 4.1 this is 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10.

## Development using Kubernetes

This section describes the local development using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).

### Requirements

To work with Kubernetes you need to install some additional software packages. Depending on your operating system, the installation instructions may vary.

The following tools are required:

- `kubectl` to manage the Kubernetes cluster
- `skaffold` for local development with Kubernetes
- `minikube,` `kind,` or `Docker Desktop` to run the Kubernetes cluster

We will use [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) to create the cluster. For macOS, [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is a good fit with most compatibility (VirtualBox currently has some issues).

The installation of `kubectl,` `kind,` and `minikube` is described in the [Kubernetes Tools installation docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).

For Mac using Docker and Homebrew, it would be the following:

1. Install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
1. `brew install kubectl minikube skaffold`

For Ubuntu Linux, it would be the following:

1. Install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
2. Install Kubectl: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/
3. Install minikube: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/
4. Install Skaffold standalone binary: https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/

### Starting the cluster

1. Ensure `Docker` is running:
   ```
   docker ps
   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                 COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS        PORTS                                                                                                                        NAMES
   ```
1. Start `minikube`:

   ```
   minikube start --memory 8192 --cpus 2
   😄  minikube v1.28.0 on Darwin 13.1
   ✨  Using the docker driver based on existing profile
   👍  Starting control plane node minikube in cluster minikube
   🚜  Pulling base image ...
   🏃  Updating the running docker "minikube" container ...
   🐳  Preparing Kubernetes v1.25.3 on Docker 20.10.20 ...
   🔎  Verifying Kubernetes components...
       ▪ Using image docker.io/kubernetesui/dashboard:v2.7.0
       ▪ Using image gcr.io/k8s-minikube/storage-provisioner:v5
       ▪ Using image docker.io/kubernetesui/metrics-scraper:v1.0.8
   💡  Some dashboard features require the metrics-server addon. To enable all features please run:

     minikube addons enable metrics-server


   🌟  Enabled addons: storage-provisioner, default-storageclass, dashboard
   🏄  Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster and "default" namespace by default
   ```

   NOTE: we start minikube with more memory since the default of 2Gb is not enough to run the whole stack comfortably.

1. Optional: Start the `minikube` dashboard in a second terminal:
   ```
   minikube dashboard
   🤔  Verifying dashboard health ...
   🚀  Launching proxy ...
   🤔  Verifying proxy health ...
   🎉  Opening http://127.0.0.1:60284/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/http:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/ in your default browser...
   ```
1. Copy the example configmap:
   ```
   cp ./k8s/django.configmap.yaml.example ./k8s/django.configmap.yaml
   ```
1. Deploy the cluster using `skaffold`:
   ```
   skaffold dev
   ```
   🎉 After some time, Loudswarm will be deployed to your local minikube cluster. In the terminal output, you will also find the information about the **forwarded ports**:
   ```
   Deployments stabilized in 16.132 seconds
   Port forwarding service/loudswarm-frontend in namespace default, remote port 80 -> http://127.0.0.1:4503
   Port forwarding service/django in namespace default, remote port 8000 -> http://127.0.0.1:8000
   Port forwarding service/mailhog in namespace default, remote port 8025 -> http://127.0.0.1:8025
   Press Ctrl+C to exit
   Watching for changes...
   ```

To stop the development cluster, terminate the process with `CTRL-C`.

### Minikube tips

1. Ensure that minikube registry addon is enabled:

   ```
   minikube addons enable registry
   ```

### Using Kind instead of Minikube for local Kubernetes cluster creation

Kind is another tool that will help us run a Kubernetes cluster locally. It runs the cluster in Docker containers and starts up faster on Linux.

Refer to https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation for installation instructions.

1. Create the cluster with kind:

   ```
   $ kind create cluster
   Creating cluster "kind" ...
   ✓ Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.25.3) 🖼
   ✓ Preparing nodes 📦
   ✓ Writing configuration 📜
   ✓ Starting control-plane 🕹️
   ✓ Installing CNI 🔌
   ✓ Installing StorageClass 💾
   Set kubectl context to "kind-kind"
   You can now use your cluster with:

   kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind

   ```

1. Run Skaffold:

   ```
   $ skaffold dev
   ```

   Since Kind is using Docker, we can see that after Skaffold builds the images, they are available on the system:

   ```
   $ docker image list
   REPOSITORY                                                      TAG                                                                IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE

### Kubernetes Useful commands and tips

1. To check the deployed applications and services, use the `kubectl` command:

   ```
   kubectl get all

1. You can inspect the logs of deployed pods using `kubectl logs` and the `id` of the pod:

   ```
   kubectl logs pod/django-9f776557-d797p
   Defaulted container "django" out of: django, check-db-ready (init)

   You have 163 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): chat, conference, django_celery_beat, edi, knox, sessions, webhooks.
   Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.
   * Running on all addresses.
     WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.

1. To run a command within one of the `pods` (e.g. creating a Django user), you can log in into the running `container` in a `pod`:
   ```
   kubectl exec -it pod/django-9f776557-d797p -- /bin/bash
   Defaulted container "django" out of: django, check-db-ready (init)
   root@django-9f776557-d797p:/app/src# python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

### Kubernetes Lens

Kubernetes Lens (https://k8slens.dev/) has a graphical user interface to explore a cluster, check logs, etc.

### Kubernetes cluster removal

If you stop skaffold with CTRL-C, it will automatically delete everything inside the cluster. It will not remove the persisted storage for `postgres`. To start with a clean database, you need to remove the persisted volume in `minikube`:

```
minikube ssh
docker@minikube:~$ pwd
/home/docker
docker@minikube:~$ cd /mnt/postgres-data
docker@minikube:/mnt/postgres-data$ ls
pgdata
docker@minikube:/mnt/postgres-data$ sudo rm -rf pgdata
```

To stop `minikube`, run `minikube stop`.
