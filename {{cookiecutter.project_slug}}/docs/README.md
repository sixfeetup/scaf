# Project Documentation

You are encouraged to add in this directory all documentation
useful for others (and you in future) to understand better
how the project work and to help developers to prepare their environment.

Examples (not all possibilities) of good things that can be documented:

- How to configure development environment using third-party
applications and integrations (e.g. Slack, Discord, external
APIs, etc);
- How to prepare the environment to accomplish a specific task
that demands business knowledge and populate data in multible tables;
- Glossary of business terms and actions that are not obvious
to the general public;
- Anything that you needed to research inside the project and
it could help a new developer not to have spent time on that research.
